# my_app
Personal practice app

My first personal application for practicing.

The above text was added by opening the README in a text editor via terminal using 'open README.md',
while this text was added by opening the README in VS Code via terminal using 'code .' while in the folder containing the README.

All confirmed changes are being committed with git.

Coding is overwhelming, but if you break everything down into bite size pieces, take it easy, one step at a time, you can progress exponentially.

------CHANGE OF PLANS------

I renamed the repo from my_app to odin-recipes via GitHub, deleted the local copy on my machine and cloned the repo again with the new name. This was going to be a personal app, but I still don't know enough to build my own thing, so I will continue The Odin Project until I feel ready to make my own app.
