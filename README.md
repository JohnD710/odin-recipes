# my_app
Personal practice app

My first personal application for practicing.

The above text was added by opening the README in a text editor via terminal using 'open README.md',
while this text was added by opening the README in VS Code via terminal using 'code .' while in the folder containing the README.

All confirmed changes are being committed with git.

Coding is overwhelming, but if you break everything down into bite size pieces, take it easy, one step at a time, you can progress exponentially.
